HowTo: Building my website    
-Gh-vue-Branch:make code changes then 'flutter build web --release'   
-Output is in build-folder("This populates a build/web directory with built files, including an assets directory, which need to be served together.")    
-Copy whole build folder and switch onto to master
-Take all from build/Web and throw into master (replace duplicates, dont clear all because of .md-File)    
done.
